## Milestone 2 expectations


- Milestone 2 is due May 2nd Monday at 11.59PM. Try and finish it earlier though, as you will be hurting your post-milestone project if you dont.
- All work upto the lab-part 3 is wanted.
- Make sure tsdb_client.py and dictdb.py have code which is
	- robust: has good exception handling
	- well tested
- you might want to make sure that tsdb_server.py is also well tested and robust. The reference implementation provided by us is NOT. This wont be tested for Milestone 2 but will most certainly be tested for the overall project.
