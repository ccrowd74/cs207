## Requirements for the paper

- 5-6 pages max, please
- one per group!
- choose an algorithm, from someplace like `sklearn`, which has an optimization. By optimization I mean code written in C and integrated, or code written in cython or SWIG or similar (optionally you could choose a more algorithmic kind of optimization, but this is not explicitly encouraged since this is a computer science and not numerical programming class)
- explain why, in your opinion, the writers felt the need of an optimization
- to do this, explain the basic algorithm by writing an implementation in pure python. You can use the project's test examples to make sure your implementation is correct.
- explain the logic of the optimization
