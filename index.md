## Who?

**Instructors:** Rahul Dave (IACS), Pavlos Protopapas (IACS)

**TFs:** Head TF: Robert Adolf, Chenhui Hu, ...

**Staff Email**: mailto:cs207staff@gmail.com

## When?

Mondays 2.30pm - 5pm Lecture and Lab. (Both compulsory) Pierce 301

Wednesdays 2.30pm - 4.30pm (Lecture Compulsory, lab highly recommended) Pierce 301

Fridays 11am-1pm (Lecture Compulsory, lab highly recommended) Pierce 301

Monday Labs are compulsory: we'll be doing group meetings then. Wed and Fri labs are highly recommended. The benefit is that with attendance you will at-most have 1/2 hour to 1 hour additional lab work at home.

## FAQ

**How onerous is it?**

Not very. If you attend the labs, you will have about 1-2.5 additional hours in the week needed to work on labs, and a further 6-8 hrs on the project (less in earlier weeks).

**What is this class about?**

Computation has long been an important tool for scientists, but the past two decades have seen a true revolution in the practice of science. Computation, in the form of both simulation and analysis, has joined theory and experimentation as the oft-quoted “third pillar” of science.

This is an applications course highlighting the use of software engineering and computer science in solving scientific problems. You will learn the
fundamentals of developing scientific software systems including abstract thinking, algorithmic development, the handling of data, and assessment of computational approaches: all in the context of good software engineering practices.


**Why take this class?**

If you are a scientist, data, physical, or social, this course will will expose you to key topics from language design and use, algorithms and data structures, and software engineering. You'll write better quality software, and be able to choose which technologies you ought to use on any given project, from its computing aspects to its data handling aspects.

If you are a computer scientist, this course will introduce you to good software engineering practice, especially in the context of scientific software development.

**Expected Learning Outcomes**

After successful completion of this course, you will be able to:

* Use Python, including its advanced features, and C, to write performant scientific programs

* understand what features of Python (or for that matter any programming language) make up its language execution model and how these features impact the code you write: e.g. how modularity, abstraction, and encapsulation can be used to solve problems

* write these programs with good software engineering practices

* code data management techniques to store data, staring from a good understanding of data structures.

* combine these techniques together to write large pieces of software (you will do a group project for this), working in a team of scientists, programmers, etc.

* Be able to hit the road running as a scientist in a startup or other company, or for that matter in academia: you will be able to evaluate and test software to see which one your group ought to use. You will also be a capable unicorn: able to contribute on both the science and software engineering sides of things.


**Who should take this class?**

The prerequisite for this class is programming knowledge, in Python, at the level of CS 109 (or above). Besides this, you should have interest or investment in scientific computing.

**What is the structure of the class?**

There will be three modules running concurrently, each focusing on an important area. These modules are "System and Software Engineering" (SSE), Language(LANG), and Data Structures and Algorithms(DSA). You will form groups and work on a project to write a time series analysis library and a time series database through the semester. This effort will exercise all three modules. Additionally you will write a paper analyzing code from a popular open-source project which uses performance optimization techniques (e.g. sklearn)
