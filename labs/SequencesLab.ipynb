    "At this point you will notice a fundamental mismatch: unlike python `list`s or `array.array`s which are dynamic, `numpy` expects you to provide a length of the sequence. This means that you cant process each element of the time series as it comes in, and must calculate the length of the input sequence to allocate space for the time series in your constructor. (This makes it hard to write a \"direct from file\" without intermdiate storage implementation; but we shall worry about this later).\n",
