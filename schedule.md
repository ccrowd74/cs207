## Weekly Schedule

Mondays 2.30pm - 5pm Lecture and Lab. (Both compulsory) Pierce 301

Wednesdays 2.30pm - 4.30pm (Lecture Compulsory, lab highly recommended) Pierce 301

Fridays 11am-1pm (Lecture Compulsory, lab highly recommended) Pierce 301

Monday Labs are compulsory: we'll be doing group meetings then. Wed and Fri labs are highly recommended. The benefit is that with attendance you will at-most have 1/2 hour to 1 hour additional lab work at home.

## Office Hours

- Rahul: By appointment (contact me, wednesday preferred)
- Chenhui: Friday 2pm-3.30pm
