## Books

No book is required. But we highly recommend two books for this course. Both are available on Hollis.

- Fluent Python: Clear, Concise, and Effective Programming, By Luciano Ramalho.
Publisher: O'Reilly Media. 2015.
- The Practice of Programming. By Brian Kernigan and Rob Pike. Publisher: Addison-Wesley. 1999
