## Project Milestone 1.

Due 25th March 2016

What ought to be in this milestone?

There are project components in the following 8 labs:

Lab07, Lab08, Lab10, Lab11, Lab12, Lab15, Lab18, Lab19

We expect:

- These above group projects upto and including Friday March 11th, 2017, or Lab 17
- a pip installable project, in the `pyscaffold` style, with two "package" modules (ie directories with `_init.py__`), `pype` and `timeseries`, as well as tests in the `test` folder of your project, as well as regular doctests in each `.py` file which show reasonable examples that would help a user.
- the tests should work locally on your machine, as well as on travis.
- each method and class you use should be documented in numpy or regular python style (see http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/ext/napoleon.html for more details and links therein; if you are using pyscaffold, these are supported out of the box)
- reasonable coverage for your tests. About 85% should be good. But make sure you've tested all the critical paths in your code.
- for tests and coverage, make sure you have travis and coveralls badges on your github repo.
